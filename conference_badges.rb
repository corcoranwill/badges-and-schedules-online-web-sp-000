# Write your code here.

def printer(attendees)
  # should puts the list of badges and room_assignments

  # The method `printer` should output first the results of the batch_badge_creator method and then of the assign_rooms method to the screen - this way you can output
  # the badges and room assignments one at a time.
  # To make this test pass, make sure you are iterating through your badges and room assignments lists.
